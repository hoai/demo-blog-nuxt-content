Subtitles are the captions displayed under the videos that are used for translating the dialogues and narratives. There are two types of video subtitles- hard subtitles and soft subtitles. The Hard subtitles are the ones which are embedded within the video as the part of the picture while the Soft subtitles are independent stream and not embedded within the video. Hardcoded subtitles are difficult to remove while the soft ones can be easily turned off when needed.

So if you want to enjoy a clean-looking video screen, you need to extract subtitles from MP4 and other formats. Know more about the process and the tools in the following parts.
